# Primary-code-for-traning-and-testing
Random forest (RF) is employed trace the role of fluids in the generation of the early Permian Tarim large igneous province (LIP) in northwestern China. Training data were extracted from the GEOROC (http://georoc.mpch-mainz.gwdg.de/georoc/) and PetDB (https://search.earthchem.org/) databases involving of 12079 samples for global island-arc basalts (IAB), mid-oceanic ridge basalts (MORB) and OIB to establish the predictive models. 
Primary code includes training and testing parts. Firstly, train models based on RF model using 12079 basalt samples, comprising 7001 IAB samples, 3962 OIB samples, and 1116 MORB samples. During the training, supplementary dataset S1 and S2 were used. Secondly, basaltic samples were tested to yield the prediction results, and Table S1 should be recalled.
